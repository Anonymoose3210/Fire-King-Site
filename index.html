        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>
            The Fire King Deck is built around destroying your own fire monsters to gain an advantage. Some cards like "Fire King High Avatar Kirin" and "Fire King Avatar Arvata" have effects that can only activate when they are destroyed, and cards like "Legendary Fire King Ponix" and "Sacred Fire King Garunix" can be summoned for free when a fire monster gets destroyed. 
        </p>

        <p>
            To activate these effects, you can use the various methods of destroying your monsters that the deck has. For instance, "Fire King Island" (which can be searched by Ponix) allows you to destroy any monster in your hand or field (and replace it with any Fire King monster). You can also use the summon-effect of Garunix, which destroys a fire monster in your deck. Another method of destruction is the quick-play spell "Fire King Sky Burn," which can not only destroy any number of fire monsters you control, but can also destroy an equal number of your opponent's cards.

        <p>There are many cards that, while not fire kings, can greatly improve the deck. One of these cards is "Promethean Princess, Bestower of Flames." Not only does this card allow you to summon a fire monster during your turn, but when your opponent performs a special summon while its in the graveyard, lets you destroy both a fire monster you control and a monster your opponent controls to bring it back from the graveyard.</p>

        <p>
            Another powerful card is "Hiita the Fire Charmer, Ablaze." This card has a very simple effect, allowing you to special summon any fire monster in your opponent's graveyard, allowing you to gather more monsters for your combos.
